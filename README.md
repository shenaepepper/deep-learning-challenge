Report on the Neural Network Model

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that can effectively classify charitable organizations based on their likelihood of receiving funding from Alphabet Soup, a fictitious philanthropic organization. The goal is to optimize the model's predictive accuracy to ensure that it can accurately predict whether a charitable organization will be successful in obtaining funding.

Data Preprocessing:
[Target Variable(s)]:
The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether a charitable organization is successful in receiving funding from Alphabet Soup (1) or not (0).
[Feature Variables]:
The feature variables for the model include:
APPLICATION_TYPE: Type of application the organization submitted for funding.
AFFILIATION: Type of affiliation the organization has.
CLASSIFICATION: Classification of the organization's activities.
USE_CASE: Use case for the funding.
ORGANIZATION: Type of organization.
STATUS: Current status of the organization.
INCOME_AMT: Income amount of the organization.
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Whether the organization has special considerations.
ASK_AMT: Amount requested for funding.
[Variables to Remove]:
The variables EIN and NAME should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features. These variables are identifiers and do not provide meaningful information for predicting the success of funding applications.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
[Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions]:
I selected a neural network model with the following architecture:
Input layer with neurons equal to the number of features in the input data.
Two hidden layers with 80 and 40 neurons, respectively, using ReLU activation functions.
Dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting.
Output layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation function, as it is a binary classification problem.
I chose this architecture to strike a balance between model complexity and performance. The ReLU activation function is commonly used in hidden layers as it introduces non-linearity and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training.
[Achieving Target Model Performance]:
The target model performance was set at achieving an accuracy higher than 75%. After training and evaluating the model, the achieved accuracy was approximately 73.22%.
[Steps to Increase Model Performance:]
To increase the model performance, I employed several optimization techniques:
Adjusted the model architecture by adding additional layers and neurons.
Implemented dropout regularization to mitigate overfitting.
Experimented with different activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, and Leaky ReLU.
Tuned hyperparameters including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Preprocessed the data further by scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables.
Explored feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features.
Utilized advanced optimization algorithms such as Adam and RMSprop.
Employed early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
The image attached summariszes the compilation, training, and evaluation of the model.
This image illustrates the process of compiling the model, training it on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the test data. It also depicts the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs to monitor the model's training progress.

Summary:
The deep learning model constructed for the classification problem of predicting the success of funding applications achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.22%. Despite efforts to optimize the model architecture, including adjusting the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and employing regularization techniques, the target performance threshold of 75% accuracy was not met. Given the complexities and challenges associated with the current deep learning approach, an alternative model that could potentially offer better performance is a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. XGBoost is known for its effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data, making it suitable for this classification problem with multiple categorical and numerical features. It performs well on a wide range of datasets and often achieves state-of-the-art results in various machine learning competitions. In conclusion, leveraging XGBoost as an alternative to deep learning could potentially yield better performance and interpretability for the classification problem of predicting funding application success. It offers robustness to overfitting, scalability, and the ability to extract valuable insights from the data, making it a promising choice for this task.
